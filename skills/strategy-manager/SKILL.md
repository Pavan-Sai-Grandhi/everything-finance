# Strategy Manager — generate → validate → pick → optimize

This skill owns a strategy's whole life. A strategy lives as a spec at `artifacts/strategies/<name>.yml` (schema: `assets/strategy-spec.example.yml`) and moves through a lifecycle:

```
 mode: generate            mode: validate              mode: optimize
 (from article)            (backtest passes)           (live edge decays)
   ┌────────┐  draft   ┌────────┐  active   ┌───────────────┐  inactive
   │ DRAFT  ├─────────▶│ ACTIVE │◀─────────▶│ OPTIMIZE/RETIRE│
   └────────┘          └───┬────┘           └───────────────┘
                           │ mode: pick (runtime regime-fit) → hand to find-trade
```

`status` is the lifecycle state (`draft | active | inactive`); **regime-fit is NOT a status** — it's decided fresh each time in `pick` mode against the live tape. Read `references/reference.md` first for the system framework, the activation thresholds, the selection logic, and the optimization rules this skill enforces.

**Sources for this skill only:** the **reference article(s) the user provides** (URL via WebFetch/curl, or a local file via Read — the strategy source, REQUIRED for `generate`), yfinance via the bundled scripts (`regime.py`, `select_strategy.py`, `aggregate_performance.py`), TradingView via computer-use (mandatory visual study in `generate`), `Skill` calls to `backtest` (validation) and `sector-pulse` (leadership), and the trade-idea artifacts under `artifacts/trades/` (closed-trade outcomes for `optimize`).

## Route to a mode

- A reference article / "design a strategy from this" → **GENERATE**.
- "backtest / validate <name>", or right after generate → **VALIDATE**.
- "what should I trade now", "pick a strategy", "which strategy fits this market" → **PICK**.
- "review / tune / optimize <name>", "is <name> still working", "should I retire <name>" → **OPTIMIZE**.
- A bare strategy name with no verb → inspect it (print status, expectancy, live_performance, regime-fit now) and offer the relevant next mode.

## Mode 1 — GENERATE (from a reference article)

This skill invents **no trade logic of its own** — it always comes from the article. It supplies the *system framework* (completeness, expectancy, %-risk sizing, regime gate). A **seed library of pre-generated drafts** (common swing methods distilled from a reference article) lives in `assets/seed-strategies/` — these are starting points the user copies into `artifacts/strategies/` and must still VALIDATE; they are `status: draft`, never a shortcut around the backtest gate.

1. **Ingest the reference(s) — REQUIRED.** URL → `WebFetch`/curl; local file → `Read`. If the user gives none, **stop and ask** for a URL/file/pasted rules. Extract — and quote the source for — the strategy's universe, entry, exit, ranking/rebalance, indicators, and the regime it claims (reference.md extraction table). Never invent trade logic.
2. **Read the regime as context.** `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/regime.py --out artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/regime.json` (Nifty trend, India VIX, breadth, risk posture). Layer macro if the user wants it; call `sector-pulse` for leadership. This informs `regime_required`, not the entry trigger.
3. **Complete the system.** Fill every component the article omits from the framework — sizing (default 1% risk), risk caps (heat 6%), `regime_required` from the article's claimed conditions (minimum structural gate if it's silent), and the **`screening` block** (how find-trade cuts the universe): the `fundamental` cut (provider `screener.in` + a query) and the `technical` cut (provider `tradingview` with server-side filter rows, or `compute` with local `lib/ta.py` predicates when TradingView can't express the filter — e.g. NR-bars, fib zones). A spec missing universe/screening/entry/exit/sizing/risk/regime is incomplete; don't emit it.
4. **TradingView visual study — REQUIRED.** Confirm the article's rules on 2–3 representative symbols via the connected browser (Claude in Chrome / Cowork computer-use / Playwright real Chrome), apply the article's indicators on its timeframe, screenshot into `artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/tv/`. If no browser is connected, **stop and ask the user to connect one**; leave `indicator_study` `PENDING`. Never fabricate screenshots or enter the user's TradingView credentials.
5. **Emit the spec as `status: draft`.** Fill `assets/strategy-spec.example.yml` → `artifacts/strategies/<name>.yml` with `source_references` populated, `lifecycle.generated_at` set, `expectancy_assumptions`/`live_performance` null. Write the rationale doc → `artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/strategy-<name>.md` citing the article for each trade rule and the framework for the risk layer. **A draft is not tradeable** — immediately offer VALIDATE.

## Mode 2 — VALIDATE (backtest → active)

Turn a draft into an active strategy *only if it earns it*.

1. Run the backtest engine via `Skill` → `backtest` against the spec (`strategy:<name>`): it reads `entry`/`exit`/`sizing`, tests the mechanical rules on historical NSE data, and writes results into the spec's `expectancy_assumptions` (`win_rate`, `expectancy_R`, `profit_factor`, `n_trades`, `validated_by`).
2. **Apply the activation gate (reference.md):** mark `status: active` **only if** `expectancy_R > 0.2` over **≥ ~30 trades**. Otherwise it stays `draft` (0–0.2R = fragile/no edge) or you mark it `inactive` (< 0R = no edge) — say which and why. On activation set `lifecycle.validated_at` and `activated_at`.
3. If the visual study never ran (`indicator_study` PENDING) it cannot go active — finish the TradingView step first.
4. Report the verdict honestly with the backtest's own caveats (in-sample, survivorship, regime concentration). A passed backtest is a hypothesis that survived history, not a guaranteed edge.

## Mode 3 — PICK (select the active strategy that fits now)

Answer "what should I trade in this market" from the **validated library**, not from a fresh opinion.

1. Refresh the regime: `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/regime.py --out artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/regime.json`.
2. Select: `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/select_strategy.py --strategies artifacts/strategies --regime artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/regime.json --out artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/selection.json`. It keeps only `status: active` specs, tests each `regime_required` against the live regime, and ranks the fitting ones by edge (live expectancy if available, else backtest).
3. Present the **selected** strategy (and the ranked runners-up), plus the ones rejected for regime-fit and why. If **none fit** (exit 11) say so plainly — the disciplined move is to stand aside, not to force a misfit strategy; suggest GENERATE/OPTIMIZE if the library is thin. If there are **no active specs** (exit 12), there's nothing validated to run — point to GENERATE→VALIDATE.
4. Hand off: tell the user to run `/find-trade strategy:<selected>` to screen live candidates against it (or just `/find-trade`, which calls this pick itself when no strategy is named).

## Mode 4 — OPTIMIZE (learn from live trades; retire what's broken)

Close the loop with reality. `trade-tracker` writes a `result` block (realized R, exit reason) into each trade-idea artifact when it closes; those are the input.

1. Aggregate: `python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/aggregate_performance.py --trades artifacts/trades --strategies artifacts/strategies [--strategy <name>] --out artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD/performance.json`. It groups closed trades by their `strategy` link and computes realized win rate, expectancy_R, profit factor, and an exit-reason breakdown, then recommends **KEEP / OPTIMIZE / DEACTIVATE** (rules in reference.md: needs ≥ 10 closed trades to act; negative live expectancy → deactivate; positive but decaying well below backtest → optimize).
2. Write the realized numbers into the spec's `live_performance` (re-run with `--update-spec` to do it, or write them yourself), with a `drift_note` comparing live vs backtest.
3. Act on the recommendation:
   - **DEACTIVATE** → set `status: inactive`, `lifecycle.deactivated_at`/`deactivated_reason` (the script does this with `--update-spec`). The strategy stops being selectable. Tell the user the edge is gone and why.
   - **OPTIMIZE** → propose a concrete rule change driven by the diagnostic (e.g. TIME exits dominate the losers → tighten `time_stop_sessions`; stops too tight → widen to structure). **Bump `version`, append an `optimization_log` entry, then re-run VALIDATE** — an optimized strategy must re-pass the backtest gate before it's active again. Never tune parameters and call it active without re-validation (that's in-sample curve-fitting).
   - **KEEP** → record the live numbers, no change.

## How other skills consume this
`find-trade` runs only an **active, regime-fitting** spec — and when the user names none, it calls this skill's PICK mode to choose one (it has no default of its own); it reads the spec's `screening`/`entry`/`exit`/`sizing`. `backtest` is the validation engine this skill drives; `deep-analysis` checks a ticker against an active strategy's regime/archetype; `trade-tracker` reads a trade's linked strategy `regime_required` for its regime-exit check and feeds closed trades back here for OPTIMIZE.

End every mode with the standard risk note. A strategy is a hypothesis at generate, a survivor at validate, a fit at pick, and a living thing at optimize — never a guaranteed edge.
